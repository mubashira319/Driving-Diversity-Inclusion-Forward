Promising trends in job diversity, regional representation, and nationality mix

Focused efforts toward gender-balanced promotions, with increased female promotions in FY21

Encouraging progress, but still more work ahead to foster an even more inclusive workplace


Let’s continue building a culture where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued.
